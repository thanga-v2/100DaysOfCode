When you create a bitcoin address for yourself (or an address/account for any other cryptocurrency), 
you generate the private key first. 
From the private key, you compute the corresponding public key and 
by hashing that public key you get your address.


It is computationally infeasible to derive the private key corresponding to a given public key.

It is possible to prove that one knows the private key corresponding to a public key without revealing any useful information about the private key in the process. 
Furthermore, such a proof can be constructed in a way that it requires a specific message to be verified. 
This way, the proof forms a digital signature for that message.
